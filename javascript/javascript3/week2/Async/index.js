// Warm up exercise. The students has to say everything they can about a variable, ONLY from the variable name. Fx the type, what it returns, what object we could expect etc.
// cars, car, title, getTitle, addTitle, isTitle, hasTitle, hasItem, users, year, yearIndex, user, review.
// DONT EXPLAIN WHAT ASYNC OR AWAIT DOES YET! Explain on a higher level:
// You have to write async before a function for await to work. No details for now
// await waits until we have fetched the data from the api. Or said in another way await waits until fetch has resolved with the data from the api

// write async before a function for await to work. What does it mean that something is asynchronous?
async function getAstronauts() {
  // await waits until we have data from fetch before it runs the next line. No need for callbacks ðŸ¤¯
