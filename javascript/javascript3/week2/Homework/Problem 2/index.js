/* Promise that resolves after set time
Create a function that has one parameter: resolveAfter. Calling this function will return a promise 
that resolves after the resolveAfter seconds has passed.

Here is an example of how to use the promise

makeUpYourOwnFunctionName(8)
    .then(() => {
        console.log('I am called asynchronously'); // logged out after 8 seconds
    })
When you have written the promise, use it with async/await */

function promise(resolveAfter) {
    
}
